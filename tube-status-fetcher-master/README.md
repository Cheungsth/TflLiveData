# tube-status-fetcher

This Application is a hobby to play around with the TFL new unified API. 
This has the intention to see how difficult to get relevant data from Tfl.

Initial goal would be: To display live tube departure information for one single station, which can be used as a information center display board for Raspberry Pi.
